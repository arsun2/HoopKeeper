# HoopKeeper

Hooperkeeper is an Android mobile app for fans/parents of a basketball player to keep
track of their playerâ€™s statistics as well as general game statistics. Involved in this process was
user research, features/user archetype brainstorming, paper/low-fidelity prototypes, gesture
proposals, as well as a complete implementation of the
application
